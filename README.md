colour-swap
===========

Half-finished class project from 2011 that operates on a given image's colours. Upon selecting an image to operate on it displays the current version of the image and a greyscale version of the image whereupon the user can:

- Select any colour from the image, select any colour of their choice and swap every instance of the first colour with the second
- Select any area on the image by drawing a closed shape and resaturate that part of the greyscale image
- Just kinda scribble on the greyscale image to resaturate those parts of the image
